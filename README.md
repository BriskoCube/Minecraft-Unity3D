# Unity Minecraft Clone Game Jam Fork

This project is a fork from [Sam Hogan's Minecraft in 24 hours](https://youtu.be/Nj8gt_92c-M). So far the following improvements have been made:

- Terrain Chunk Generation is now multi-thread and out of the render loop to fix the lag.
- Added a chase AI.
- Basic chase zombie.
- Viking model for the main player.
- Update nearby chunks when updating terran to fix visual errors.
