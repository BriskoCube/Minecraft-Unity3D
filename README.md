# Unity Voxel Community Porject

This project is a fork from [Sam Hogan's Minecraft in 24 hours](https://youtu.be/Nj8gt_92c-M).

The aim of this project is to build a game for fun of the development. The end project is just a means
to that end. I encourage anyone to contribute anything they feel will make this project better. There's
no vision or design. I recommend just playing the project, thinking of an element that's easy to add
that would improve the game and send a pull request.

So far the following improvements have been made:

- Terrain Chunk Generation is now multi-thread and out of the render loop to fix the lag.
- Added a chase AI.
- Basic chase zombie.
- Viking model for the main player.
- Update nearby chunks when updating terran to fix visual errors.
- Day/Night cycle

# Contributing

If you're interested in helping with project I'll be very liberal in accepting pull request so send away!
